 * The "atomic" actors are contextualizers, represented by k.LAB
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.KServiceCall.api.IServiceCall}s that serve as entry
 * points into the runtime.

 * Some actuators may be references, corresponding to "input ports" in other
 * workflow systems. In a k.LAB computation, references are always resolved and
 * the implementing which case the original actuator will always be serialized
 * before any references to it.

/**
 * An Artifact can be any of the first-class products of a k.LAB task: a non-semantic
 * {@link KDataArtifact} or {@link KObjectArtifact}, an observed (semantic) {@link KObservation} (as
 * produced by most activities in k.LAB) or a {@link KKimModelStatement k.IM model description} when the
 * model has been produced by an observation activity, such as a learning model.
 * <p>
 * By implementing {@link java.lang.Iterable}, we also allow Artifacts to represent groups of
 * artifacts (e.g. all the {@link KSubject subjects} instantiated by resolving a subject
 * {@link KObservable observable}). This enables simpler handling of provenance, as each observation
 * activity returns one artifact, possibly iterable as a group.
 * <p>
 * From an OPM perspective, IArtifact is the equivalent of Entity, including its specialization into
 * Bundle if size() > 1.
 * <p>
 * Each artifact exposes the provenance graph it's part of, allowing all k.LAB tasks to simply
 * return any {@code IArtifact} and provide full information on what happened.
 * <p>

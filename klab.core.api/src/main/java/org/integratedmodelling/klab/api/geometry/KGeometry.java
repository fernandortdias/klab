/**
 * A IGeometry is the declaration of the topological dimensions for the artifacts specified by (or
 * allowed for) a resource or computation (for example a resource identified by a URN) or by a
 * {@link KPrototype#getGeometry() service prototype} declared in KDL). When used in such a
 * declarative fashion it may have a granularity > 1, meaning that it describes a multiplicity of
 * resources, and one child geometry describing the geometry of each resource.
 * <p>
 * Geometries apply to artifacts, so they do not contain any semantic information. In k.LAB,
 * observations (the semantic peer of artifact) expose into a worldview-aware {@code IScale scale}
 * ({@code IWorldview#getScale(IGeometry)}) instead, whose API extends {@code IGeometry}. The scale
 * also precisely locates the geometry and guarantees valid values of the corresponding
 * <strong>shape</strong>, consisting of long sizes and extents, which the geometry can describe
 * using {@link #size()} and its {@link Dimension#shape() dimensions} but is allowed to leave them
 * unspecified. When used as a {@code IScale} the geometry is currently always associated to an
 * observation, not to a computation or resource, so it never has granularity != 1. Currently a
 * non-API observation group (corresponding to the object artifact) exposes the overall S/T scale
 * but does not specify granularity.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Declaring geometries</strong>
 * <p>
 * A geometry can be declared through a simple string (which is also its string value). Each
 * dimension can use S/s for space, T/t for time, and any other uppercase/lowercase letters except S
 * and T for other extents (the latter are currently unused and will need a "legend" of sort if/when
 * so). The correspondent Greek letters (sigma and tau) can be used to specify "generic" dimensions,
 * which are stated to exist and may have a resolution but are aspecific w.r.t. their actual
 * location and topology.
 * <p>
 * Each letter can be used alone if the shape consists of one extent without subdivisions, or it can
 * be followed by the number of dimensions for each extent if subdivided: so T will mean located in
 * time but not distributed, while T1 will mean located and distributed in time along a
 * 1-dimensional topology (with an arbitrary 'shape', i.e. number of subdivisions). If the uppercase
 * letter is used, the topology is regular and the only information needed to characterize it is the
 * number of subdivisions (return value of {@link Dimension#shape()}). If the letter is lowercase,
 * the topology is irregular. Use the uppercase letter if there is no subdivision.
 * <p>
 * The trivial case is a scalar geometry, describing scalars with no structure and specified by an
 * asterisk (<code>*</code>). Scalar geometries cannot be assigned parameters, nor, obviously, a
 * shape. An empty geometry (which is useless except to report errors) is specified by an uppercase
 * <code>X</code>. Scalar geometries are useful: for example, a resolver for any countable will have
 * scalar geometry and void type.
 * <p>
 * If the shape is only letters with optional numbers, the topology applies to a single object
 * ({@link #getGranularity()} == {@link Granularity#SINGLE}). Otherwise, it can be prefixed by
 * <code>#</code>, which distributes the geometry across multiple objects ({@link #getGranularity()}
 * == {@link Granularity#MULTIPLE}). Objects that are children of another or others are defined
 * after a comma. So for example
 * <p>
 * 
 * <code>
 * TS3,#S2
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>
 * denotes a single 3-dimensional regular spatial geometry (voxel cube), referenced but not
 * distributed in time and containing multiple sub-objects with just a 2-dimensional spatial
 * geometry; while
 * <p>
 * 
 * <code>
 * #s0
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * denotes a non-temporal set of irregular points in space. This notation assumes that all
 * dimensions of a topology are either regular or irregolar.

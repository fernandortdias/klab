/**
 * A dataflow is the result of k.LAB resolution, and will instantiate and
 * populate the resulting observations when run.
 *
 * This package contains a simple workflow implementation, redesigned to be a
 * stripped-down, structurally compatible version of Ptolemy's workflow so that
 * we can consider compiling resolution graphs into distributed workflows when
 * there is a context for that.

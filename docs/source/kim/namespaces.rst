Introduction: project organization and namespaces
=================================================

In most situations, semantic content specified in k.IM will be organized into *namespaces*, which are in turn collected into *projects*. Projects may be served as a parts of *workspaces*. For example, the worldview that k.LAB loads after the certificate is read is a workspace composed of several projects, each providing semantics for some domains of knowledge.

The basic unit of specification is the namespace, which corresponds to one resource (usually a file on disk). Within a namespace, you write statements that specify concepts, models, or observations.

Only in special situations namespaces are allowed to exist outside of projects. Such situations are defined in .... We assume in this section that namespaces are always within a project, and the project is within a workspace. The k.LAB IDE is the suggested environment 
to develop in k.IM, and it enforces this organization by providing a default workspace (equivalent with the Eclipse workspace) and wizards
to create k.IM projects and to create and edit namespaces within them.

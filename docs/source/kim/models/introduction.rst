Introduction
============

Simply put, models define observations by linking information resources to semantics from a worldview. A :keyword:`model` statement consists, at its simplest, of the :keyword:`model` keyword followed by the URN of a resource and the declaration of the semantics it represents:

.. code-block:: kim
	
	// locally available resource
	model data/dem.tiff as geography:Elevation;

A technical introduction to k.LAB
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This note describes k.LAB, a full-stack solution for the activity of _integrated modeling_, which reconciles strong 
semantics with information stewardship and modeling practice, helping achieve advantages such as modularity, 
interoperability, reusability, and integration of multiple paradigms and scales. 

The centerpoing of k.LAB's innovation is an AI engine that assembles resources into computations (scientific workflows or *dataflows*) based on the contents of a semantic web deployed using the k.LAB software. The AI resolves concepts to dataflows based on the context of resolution: for example, resolving .... will produce a dataflow involving ..., based on .... This mechanism effectively decouples ... 

* Uniform management of distributed non-semantic assets encompassing datasets, models and web services, identified by a unique URN resolved on the network;
* A platform to build semantic annotations of such assets and of algorithms linking and processing them, and to publish such annotations on networked servers;

Semantic, non-semantic and model assets in k.LAB
================================================

Types of assets. All identified by a unique URN. The main paradigm: non-semantic assets annotated with semantic assets and operated upon by 

Non-semantic assets: the resource lifecycle
-------------------------------------------

URN and their resolution. What is wrapped and how. Local -> public resources. Include geometry, metadata and provenance info that is assmbled into the final provenance graph for each dataflow.

Semantic assets: the worldview
-------------------------------


Models:
-------------------------------

Contextualizers as points of extension. Wrapping and adapting web and multi-platform code.

Resolution and its products
============================

Sessions and Example session. 

Report, dataflow, provenance. Each dataflow can become a resource for reproducibility and be annotated anew.

Possible use cases: embedded, modeler,

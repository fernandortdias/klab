Brief intro on main categories recognized by the k.LAB core ontology.

Preamble on subjects as context, and the need for their acknowledgement before anything is observed. They set the main inherency for the observations, used implicitly in resolution: observing elevation after setting context to a Region means observing Elevation within Region. Because elevation is defined as ... it inherits "Location", and because Region is a location, any model of Elevation succeeds without having to explicitly mention the context.

=== Qualities

Qualities can only exist inherently to a countable observation (subject, event, relationship)
They are indirect observables because they can only be observed relative to a reference value (unit, classification system, currency).
They inherit scale from their inherent subject; spatial and temporal representation are handled and mediated transparently.
Units and currencies are also mediated transparently whenever possible.
Inherency can be specified in models: “Height of Tree within Region”, “Sediment Mass within Riverine Reach”.
Quality semantics admits operators in models: “LandCoverType without Urban”, “value of CarbonSequestration by LandCoverType”, “Elevation where (LandCoverType is Forest)”. This enables modeling in English without loss of semantics

=== Subjects and agents
Subjects are physical direct observations in that they are simply acknowledged: their statement is enough to put them into existence.
Agents are special subjects that may be reactive, interactive, or deliberative, enabling different potential actions from their behaviors.
All  subjects are instantiated and resolved (explained and given a behavior) by different models. This gives much flexibility to the modeller as the instantiators and resolvers may be contextualized differently. 
Qualities, processes, events within them are declared with independent models and linked by semantic dependencies. 
A root subject is the context for all modelling sessions. The view of time and space embedded in the root subject are the overall scale for the session, although each observation may see time and space differently.

=== Predicates

Roles, Attributes, Identities, Realms
Collectively called predicates: they can only modify an observable but cannot be observed themselves.
Each predicate carries semantics and is applied in k.IM as in English, building derived concepts transparently.
Predicates are instantiated and resolved just like observables. They may be conferred by processes or events, after which they are automatically resolved.
Identities are the bridge to controlled vocabularies, which we call authorities and are supported by the software. Examples: GBIF, Agrovoc, IUPAC InChem.
Roles can imply other roles contextually to specific observables, allowing selective resolution of qualities or behaviors.
Attribute instantiators can bridge to classification models from machine learning.


=== Inherency

Inherency is ... It concerns the most important semantic operators and needs to be understood fully. Two operators, `within` and `of`, express **direct** and **indirect** respectively. Where to use each.

The {klab} annotation conventions are built around the fact that inherency _affects resolution and validation_. So we do not use it indiscriminately but only when we need to trigger these behaviors. When we need to simply qualify an observable we use predicates (identities or others) instead. So in {kim} expressions like

[source,kim]
----
occurrence of agriculture:Pollinator ecology:Nesting
----

are used in place of the seemingly correct 

[source,kim]
----
occurrence of ecology:Nesting of agriculture:Pollinator biology:Individual
----

The second use does not seem semantically incorrect (it is certainly acceptable _linguistically_), until you consider what inherency actually means.... It would cause the resolver to try and resolve.. In comparison, the predicate simply _subsets_ the concept of nesting to the set of events that have to do with pollinators.

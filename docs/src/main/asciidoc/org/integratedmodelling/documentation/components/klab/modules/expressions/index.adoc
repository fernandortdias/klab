= Writing expressions in k.IM

The default expression language in k.IM is a superset of the https://groovy-lang.org[Groovy] language, which is interoperable with the underlying Java implementation. Expressions written within square brackets are first preprocessed to recognize and translate forms that are specific of k.IM and its semantic underpinnings, then passed to the Groovy interpreter for compilation and execution, with a set of predefined variables giving access to the scope of the observation being made. Expressions in k.IM appear within square brackets, for example in models 

 example 

or as parameters to functions or other definitions. (examples)

 example

Because the square bracket is also a legal Groovy character, and is used to address elements lists (by index) or maps (by key), the closing square bracket must be quoted with a backslash character when used _inside_ an expression:

 example

NOTE:: There is currently _no_ validation of expression syntax in the k.IM editor. Some may become available in the future but it's unlikely to ever catch all the possible errors. Groovy syntax is very permissive and besides parenthesis matching and other obvious checks, _ex-ante_ syntax validation is often ineffective in preventing errors. You are responsible for using correct syntax and as the errors resulting from invalid expressions can be obscure and difficult to debug, great care should be taken when writing expressions to avoid time-consuming debugging.

Disabled Groovy syntax: **is** operator, preprocessed and usable only among semantic objects. Its normal purpose (reference equality) in Groovy is not accessible. Slashy strings are also disabled.

|Variable |Description

|**#(....)**
|A pair of parentheses prefixed by the pound sign is preprocessed into a function call producing a k.IM observable, which may include units, semantic and value operators, and more parenthesized forms. 
|_<namespace>_**:**_<Concept>_
|All k.IM concept URNs are preprocessed into a function call producing a k.IM concept when they appear outside of an observable form. This form is only recognized if there are no spaces before or after the colon.
|**unknown**
|The k.IM keyword **unknown** is syntactic sugar for the **null** value, for uniformity with the k.LAB notion of "no data". 
|_<dependency>_ **@** _<locator>_
|When _dependency_ corresponds to the name of a dependent quality (e.g. using a `named` clause in the `observing` section of a model declaration) and the expression is being evaluated value-wise in a scalar context, the **@** operator can be used to intuitively _locate_ the value in different parts of the context. See xref:todo[below] for the types of locators that can be used.
|_<concept>_ (**is**\|**isa**) _<concept>_
|When applied to concepts and observables, the **is** operator invokes the reasoner and checks for subsumption using logical inference, instead of triggering the default Groovy behavior of checking for object reference equality. In the **isa** form, it also enables extensions to check for trait and role inheritance (see xref:todo[below]). Results of inference are cached in the engine for speed.
|time **<<** _<n>_, time **>>** _<n>_
|The Groovy operators **<<** and **>>**, when applied to the *time* variable (see below) or any other variable containing a time extent, will return the _previous_ and _next_ time period according to the scale of contextualization. These can be used for any purpose, including retrieving data from previous (obviously not future) states using the **@** operator. Note that the previous time for the beginning of the contextualized time is the start time itself, and the same holds for the next after the end. The special temporal state _initialization_ is _not_ retrieved by moving the start time backwards: the only way to retrieve the initialization state is by using **time.init**.

== Predefined variables

[cols="1,6,1"]
|===
|Variable |Description | Context

|**self**
|Refers to the "natural" target of the computation. According to the context, it may refer to the current value of a quality being computed or to the entire observation being defined. When used in contexts different from a "set [_<quality observation>_] to" instruction in a model, it may point to a different object according to implementation.
|All
|**context**
|Refers to the context subject that directly owns the observation being computed. If the computation is a subject resolution, `self == context`.
|Models
|**scale**
|Refers to the xref:todo[scale] of computation of the current computation. In a scalar context, the space will be the immediate subdivision being computed. Time is normally the current period of time for the model. The _overall_ scale is available through `context.scale`. 
|Models
|**space**
|Refers to the current xref:todo[space] of computation. Shortcut for `scale.space`. According to the context, it may be a grid cell, a polygon, a volumetric shape, a line, a point. In scalar context, the overall space can be obtained through `context.scale.space`.
|Models
|**time**
|Refers to the current xref:todo[time] of computation. Shortcut for `scale.time`. Time is a complex Java object which always incarnates a period, never a point. The current time is seen atomically within this model, with no further subdivisions, but may be further subdivided in other models. In scalar context, the overall time can be obtained through `context.scale.time`.
|Models
|**scope**
|Refers to the xref:todo[contextualization scope], which contains the current state of the computation for the target observation and any other being defined in the context.
|Models
|**dataflow**
|Refers to the xref:todo[dataflow] that the runtime is executing. It can be interrogated to find out dependencies, models and parameters being applied.
|Models
|**provenance**
|Refers to the xref:todo[provenance graph] defined in the context so far. Note that provenance is built _after_ computation, so nothing will be known about observation that haven't been reached yet by the dataflow. You can interrogate the provenance to know the origin of resources, which transformations have happened so far to the data you are seeing, and which agent started the computation.
|Models
|**cell**
|Refers to the current raster cell and is defined only when the space in the context is a grid. Enables xref:todo[access to the cell's neighborhood] and to the values of other dependencies within it.

=== Concepts and observables

Note the difference in use of the **is** operator when applied to conceptual values: while in Groovy it is a synonym of reference equality (two object being the same object), in k.IM it is preprocessed into the `is` operator for inferential comparison, invoking the reasoner.

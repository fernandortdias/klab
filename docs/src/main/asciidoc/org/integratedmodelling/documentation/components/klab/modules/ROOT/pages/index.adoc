= Welcome to the k.LAB documentation site

image::KLAB_LOGO.png[align=center]

This site will contain the most current documentation for {kl}, a semantic web software platform for science, as it is developed. At the time of this writing, no documentation has been publicly released. The links in the navigation bar offer a perspective on what this site will eventually contain, but most links are not functional yet.

IMPORTANT: The xref:technote:ROOT:index.adoc[Technical note] available on this site is, at the moment, the best source of information to independently learn about {kl}'s features and architecture.

The {kl} software stack powers platforms such as https://aries.integratedmodelling.org[ARIES] and applications such as https://seea.un.org/content/aries-for-seea[ARIES for SEEA]. The https://integratedmodelling.org[Integrated Modelling Partnership] maintains {kl} and the majority of the projects based on it. 

Inquiries about {kl} should be addressed to info@integratedmodelling.org.

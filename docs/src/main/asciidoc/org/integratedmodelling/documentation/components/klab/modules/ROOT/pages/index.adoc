= Welcome to the k.LAB documentation site

NOTE: At the time of this writing, no documentation has been publicly released. The xref:technote:ROOT:index.adoc[Technical note] available on this site is the best source of information to learn about {kl}'s features and architecture.

The {kl} software stack powers platforms such as https://aries.integratedmodelling.org[ARIES] and applications such as https://seea.un.org/content/aries-for-seea[ARIES for SEEA]. The https://integratedmodelling.org[Integrated Modelling Partnership] maintains {kl} and the majority of the projects based on it.

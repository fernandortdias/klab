The CLUE-s model will be installed in the directory you
specify. All input files of the model should be located
in this directory. Output will also be written to this
directory.
If you use ArcView as GIS package for displaying data we
recommend you to install the CLUE-s model in a directory
with a name that does not contain any white spaces. White
spaces will cause malfunctioning of the ArcView data import
utility.
A manual for the model is included in the 'help' function.
New model versions and tutorial exercises can be found at
the CLUE website: http://www.cluemodel.nl

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Begin supporting recontextualization of distributed states in expressions through @-modified identifiers 
  (e.g. elevation@nw).
- Add CLI 'kbox' command namespace for kbox inquiries and enable 'reason info' for ontologies.
- Support 'equals' instead of 'is' in concept declarations to declare aliases instead
  of new concepts. All implications still to be tested.
- Begin reintegrating authorities, starting from GBIF.
- Add syntax to refer to a pure authority identity as a concept (identity ID by AUTH.ID).
### Changed
- Derived concepts are created within the ontology hosting the main concept once again. 
  This is needed otherwise the import structure becomes circular; should probably eliminate 
  the configurable option.
### Fixed
- Better handling of Groovy expressions using and returning concepts.
- Fixed some NPE situations when parsing models with unknown semantics.
- Fixed situations where observables would not be compatible with themselves due to 
  inherency chain issues.
- Fixes in attributes exported with shapefiles.

## [0.10.0.150] -- 2019/03/11
### Added
- Begin keeping this changelog.
- Prototype of configuration detector.
- ML/Weka component is functional (Weka bridge through functions, prediction of distributed qualities and their uncertainties); 
  generation of models and resources with import/export still unimplemented.
- Function and annotation documentation appears on hover in k.Modeler.
- Service workspace for scratch resources and user-level explorer uploads and scenarios is 
  created and managed by the engine.
- Beginning of resource add by drop functionalities (imports resource in scratch project; 
  sets context if resource is object and none is defined).
- Improved and generalized observation export features using adapters.
- Export to shapefile working for both individual observations and folders.
- Hyperlink resource names to resource editor in modeler when ctrl-clicked.
### Changed
- Make local resource database in-memory for now.
- Improve docs and handle concept count in GIS neighborhood resolver.
### Fixed
- Additional output states created and reported.
- New context notification includes scale.
- Various bug fixes.
